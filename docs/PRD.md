# Product Requirements Document - Nederland Stemt

## Vision & Mission

Nederland Stemt gives every Dutch citizen a direct voice in national priorities. No politicians, no parties, no bureaucracy - just the pure, unfiltered will of the people, measured weekly. We transform democratic participation from a once-every-four-years event into a continuous conversation about what truly matters to the Netherlands.

We're not building another petition platform or discussion forum. We're creating the first real-time barometer of national sentiment that forces politicians to confront what citizens actually want, not what lobbyists or party leaders tell them citizens want. Every vote is public, transparent, and impossible to ignore.
